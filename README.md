## üéûÔ∏è Movie Recommendation Based on OTT Services üéûÔ∏è

---

### Project Description

<aside>
üìå     Rather than watching movie in the theater, people now mostly watch movies using OTT services such as Netflix, Watcha, Disney+, etc. However as too many OTT services are coming out, people might have difficulties in selecting which OTT service they would use. There is no good solution of choosing the suitable OTT service based on each user‚Äôs movie taste. Our team MS infinity are planning to develop a web service which recommends movie using datasets of movies listed by rates, OTT services, and themes. We are expecting
that our web service can give the solution of which OTT service to subscribe.
    User will be able to search for movies based on era (division movies by decades), OTT services, Genre, and events (like Halloween, Christmas, New Year, etc.). Each movie information will include rates, reviews, available OTT services, and other basic information. User can bookmark each movie they like, and our service will recommend the suitable OTT service which provide movies similar to the bookmarked movies as user bookmarks enough movies. Also our service will include movie review board where users can leave opinions of some movies and talk about it with other users. This will also help users to check which movies are popular these days and meet people with similar movie taste.
